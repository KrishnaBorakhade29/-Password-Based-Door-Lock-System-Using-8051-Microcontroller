# Password-Based Door Lock System Using 8051 Microcontroller
The Password-Based Door Lock System Using 8051 Microcontroller is a simple yet effective security solution for controlling access to restricted areas. This project uses an 8051 microcontroller to verify user-entered passwords and manage a locking mechanism. It enhances security by ensuring that only authorized individuals with the correct password can access the secured space. The system provides visual feedback using an LCD display and offers a cost-effective solution for home automation and office security.
## Technologies Used
#### 8051 Microcontroller: Core processing unit for password verification and system control.

#### Keypad: Used for user input to enter the password.

#### LCD Display: Provides real-time feedback such as "Enter Password," "Access Granted," and "Access Denied."

#### DC Motor/Relay: Operates the door lock mechanism.

#### Embedded C: Programming language for writing microcontroller code.

#### Keil uVision IDE: Development environment for code compilation and debugging.

#### Proteus Simulation Software: For testing the circuit design before hardware implementation.
